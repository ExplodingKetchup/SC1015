# App Rating Repository

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC10155 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on [Google Play Store Apps](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1. [Data Preprocessing and EDA](https://github.com/ExplodingKetchup/SC1015/blob/main/preprocessing_and_eda.ipynb)
2. [Random Forest](https://github.com/ExplodingKetchup/SC1015/blob/main/Random%20Forest.ipynb)
3. [eXtreme Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/ExplodingKetchup/SC1015/blob/main/xgb.ipynb)

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict the rating of an app on the Google Play Store based on its features?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Random Forest
2. eXtreme Gradient Boosting
3. Neural Networks

## Conclusion

- It is possible to predict the rating of an app with acceptable amount of accuracy
